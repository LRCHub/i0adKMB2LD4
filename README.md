[00:25.70] She had a face straight outta magazine
[00:35.68] God only knows, but you'll never leave her
[00:45.37] Her balaclava is starting to chafe
[00:52.46] And when she gets his gun
[00:54.81] He's begging "Babe, stay, stay
[00:58.54] Stay, stay, stay"
[01:07.04] 
[01:01.95] "And I'll give you one more time
[01:06.97] We'll give you one more fight
[01:11.79] Said one more line
[01:16.69] Will I know you?"
[01:25.19] 
[01:28.50] Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
[01:38.30] And if you never eat, you'll never grow
[01:47.56] And you got a pretty kind of dirty face
[01:55.15] And when she's leaving your home
[01:58.09] She's begging you to stay, stay
[02:01.50] Stay, stay, stay
[02:09.50] 
[02:04.53] "And I'll give you one more time
[02:09.50] We'll give you one more fight
[02:14.66] Said one more line
[02:18.30] There'll be a riot, 'cause I know you"
[02:37.30] 
[02:26.67] Well, now that you've got your gun
[02:31.39] It's much harder now the police have come
[02:36.15] And I'll shoot him if it's what you ask
[02:41.10] But if you'd just take off your mask
[02:44.52] You'd find out that everything's gone wrong
[02:51.19] (London, sing it to me)
[03:02.69] 
[02:54.32] Now everybody's dead
[02:58.02] And they're driving past my old school
[03:03.51] And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on
[03:08.83] She says, "Babe, baby, you look so cool"
[03:16.75] You look so cool
[03:21.41] You look so cool
[03:29.41] 
[03:31.12] You look so cool (one more time)
[03:35.83] You look so cool (one more fight)
[03:40.85] You look so cool (one more line, 'cause I know you)
